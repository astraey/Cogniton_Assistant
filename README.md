<h3>Cognition Assistant :ocean:</h3>

<p>The idea of this project is to enhance the senses of the visually impaired through technology, specifically with Microsoft’s Computer Vision Technology.</p>

<p>Our system is composed of a number of wearables that are connected to a pair of smart glasses. Based on what the camera on the glasses sees, it sends a specific signal to the wearables. This signal is then transformed into not only sound but vibrations, electric signals or heat. The idea is that after a time of adaptation, the user becomes to used to this signals that they feel like an extension of his own senses, having a huge impact on the user’s lifestyle. This is a highly modular system, and new modules can be easily added. With enough wearables you can achieve a significant combination of signals which gives the user a lot of information about his environment.</p>

<p>A simple implementation of the system has been a platform that runs on the user’s smart glasses. When the user interacts with another person, the system detects his facial expression and sends a signal to the user. The user receives the signal as a sound, but it would perform better if the signal was a vibration to the wristband of the user.</p>
